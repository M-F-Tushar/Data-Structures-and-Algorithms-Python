## 1. Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

### 1.1 What is OOP and Why Use It?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into **objects**, which are instances of **classes**. OOP models real-world entities, making it easier to manage complex software projects by breaking them into modular, reusable components.

**Why OOP is Needed in This Course:**
- The course transitions from using Python’s built-in data structures to creating **custom data structures** (e.g., linked lists).
- Custom data structures require OOP concepts like **classes**, **objects**, **attributes**, and **methods** to define and manipulate them effectively.
- OOP enables modular design, allowing teams to work on separate components simultaneously, improving productivity and code reusability.

**Real-World Analogy: Smart Robot Project**
- **Scenario**: Building software for a smart robot with components like a processor, touch sensors, speech recognition, and degrees of freedom.
- **OOP Approach**:
  - Break the project into **modules** (e.g., processor module, sensor module).
  - Each module is developed by a separate team, improving efficiency.
  - Modules are reusable across projects (e.g., using the same processor module for a smart dog).
- **Benefits**:
  - **Modularity**: Divides complex tasks into manageable pieces.
  - **Reusability**: Code modules can be reused in other projects.
  - **Scalability**: Easier to manage and extend large projects.

**Real-World Analogy: Hotel Management**
- **Scenario**: Running a hotel with roles like receptionist, housekeeper, chef, and accountant.
- **Procedural Programming Issue**: One person handling all roles (reception, cleaning, cooking, accounting) is inefficient and error-prone, like writing a large program with only functions.
- **OOP Solution**:
  - Each role is an **object** with specific **attributes** (data, e.g., receptionist’s name) and **methods** (behaviors, e.g., reserving rooms).
  - A manager oversees objects without needing to know the details of each role.
- **Benefits**:
  - Simplifies complex systems by assigning specialized roles.
  - Enhances scalability and maintainability.

**Key Takeaway**: OOP allows developers to model real-world systems by breaking them into objects with specific roles, making code modular, reusable, and easier to manage.

## 2. Core OOP Concepts

### 2.1 Class
A **class** is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It specifies what data (attributes) an object will have and what actions (methods) it can perform.

- **Analogy**: A cookie cutter (class) defines the shape of cookies (objects) but is not a cookie itself.
- **Components of a Class**:
  1. **Name**: Identifies the class (e.g., `StarCookie`).
  2. **Attributes**: Variables that describe the object’s properties (e.g., weight, color).
  3. **Methods**: Functions that define the object’s behaviors (e.g., decorate, consume).

**Example**: A class for a smart robot defines attributes like `color`, `battery_level`, and methods like `detect_speech` or `walk`.

### 2.2 Object
An **object** is an instance of a class, created based on the class’s blueprint. Each object has its own identity and can have different attribute values, even if created from the same class.

- **Analogy**: Cookies cut from the same star-shaped cutter are objects. Each cookie can have different colors or weights but shares the same shape.
- **Instantiation**: The process of creating an object from a class.
- **Example**: Two smart robots (`robot_a`, `robot_b`) created from the `SmartRobot` class can have different battery levels or colors.

### 2.3 Attribute
An **attribute** is a variable associated with an object, representing its properties or state.

- **Types of Attributes**:
  - **Instance Attributes**: Unique to each object (e.g., `color` of a cookie).
  - **Class Attributes**: Shared across all objects of a class (e.g., `milk` required for all cookies).
- **Example**: A housekeeper object might have attributes like `is_cleaning` (True/False) and `responsible_floor` (e.g., 2nd and 3rd floors).

### 2.4 Method
A **method** is a function defined within a class that describes the behaviors or actions an object can perform. Methods are tied to specific objects and can access their attributes.

- **Difference from Functions**: Methods are associated with objects, while functions are standalone.
- **Example**: A housekeeper object might have methods like `clean_floor()` and `notify_supervisor()`.

**Key Takeaway**: Classes define the structure (attributes) and behavior (methods) of objects. Objects are instances of classes with independent identities and attribute values.

## 3. Creating Classes and Objects in Python

### 3.1 Defining a Class
In Python, a class is defined using the `class` keyword, followed by the class name (in PascalCase) and a colon. The class body is indented.

**Syntax**:
```python
class ClassName:
    pass  # Placeholder for empty class
```

**Naming Convention**:
- **PascalCase**: Capitalize the first letter of each word (e.g., `StarCookie`, `SmartRobot`).
- Differs from **camelCase** (e.g., `starCookie`) and **snake_case** (e.g., `star_cookie`), which are used for variables or functions.

**Example: Creating an Empty Class**
```python
class StarCookie:
    pass
```

- The `pass` keyword is used to create an empty class without errors, as Python expects indented code after a colon.
- This class serves as a blueprint for creating star-shaped cookie objects.

### 3.2 Creating Objects
Objects are created by calling the class name with parentheses, similar to calling a function. This process is called **instantiation**.

**Syntax**:
```python
object_name = ClassName()
```

**Example: Creating Objects**
```python
star_cookie_1 = StarCookie()
star_cookie_2 = StarCookie()
```

- `star_cookie_1` and `star_cookie_2` are two distinct objects (instances) of the `StarCookie` class.
- Each object has its own identity, and changes to one do not affect the other.

**Output**:
```python
print(star_cookie_1)  # <StarCookie object at 0x...>
print(star_cookie_2)  # <StarCookie object at 0x...>
```

- The output shows memory addresses, confirming that `star_cookie_1` and `star_cookie_2` are separate objects.

---

## 4. Working with Attributes

### 4.1 Instance Attributes
Instance attributes are unique to each object and are typically initialized using the `__init__` method, a special method (constructor) that runs when an object is created.

**Syntax for `__init__`**:
```python
class ClassName:
    def __init__(self, param1, param2):
        self.param1 = param1
        self.param2 = param2
```

- **`self`**: Refers to the object being created. It’s a Python convention for the first parameter of instance methods.
- Parameters (`param1`, `param2`) are passed when creating the object and used to set attributes.

**Example: Initializing Attributes**
```python
class StarCookie:
    def __init__(self, color, weight):
        self.color = color
        self.weight = weight

# Create objects
star_cookie_1 = StarCookie("red", 15)
star_cookie_2 = StarCookie("blue", 16)

# Access attributes
print(star_cookie_1.color)  # Output: red
print(star_cookie_1.weight)  # Output: 15
print(star_cookie_2.color)  # Output: blue
print(star_cookie_2.weight)  # Output: 16
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The `__init__` method initializes `color` and `weight` for each object.
  - `self.color` and `self.weight` are instance attributes, unique to each object.
  - When creating `star_cookie_1`, we pass `"red"` and `15` as parameters, setting its attributes.
  - Similarly, `star_cookie_2` has its own `color` (`blue`) and `weight` (`16`).

**Manual Attribute Assignment (Less Preferred)**:
```python
star_cookie_1 = StarCookie()
star_cookie_1.color = "red"
star_cookie_1.weight = 15
```

- **Issue**: Manually assigning attributes is error-prone (e.g., typos like `colour` instead of `color`) and repetitive, especially for multiple objects.
- **Solution**: Using `__init__` ensures consistency and reduces errors.

### 4.2 Default Attribute Values
Attributes can have default values in the `__init__` method, eliminating the need to pass them when creating objects.

**Example: YouTube User Class with Default Attributes**
```python
class YouTube:
    def __init__(self, username, subscribers=0):
        self.username = username
        self.subscribers = subscribers

# Create objects
user_1 = YouTube("Elshad")
user_2 = YouTube("Renat")

# Access attributes
print(f"{user_1.username} subscribers: {user_1.subscribers}")  # Output: Elshad subscribers: 0
print(f"{user_2.username} subscribers: {user_2.subscribers}")  # Output: Renat subscribers: 0

# Modify attribute
user_2.subscribers = 5
print(f"{user_2.username} subscribers: {user_2.subscribers}")  # Output: Renat subscribers: 5
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The `subscribers` parameter has a default value of `0`, so it’s optional when creating objects.
  - `user_1` and `user_2` are created with only `username` provided, and `subscribers` is set to `0` by default.
  - Attributes can be modified later (e.g., `user_2.subscribers = 5`).

**Pitfall: Typos Create New Attributes**
```python
user_2.subscriber = 5  # Typo: 'subscriber' instead of 'subscribers'
print(user_2.subscribers)  # Output: 0 (original attribute unchanged)
print(user_2.subscriber)   # Output: 5 (new attribute created)
```

- **Issue**: Python allows adding new attributes dynamically, which can lead to errors if you mistype an attribute name.
- **Solution**: Define all attributes in `__init__` to avoid accidental creation of new attributes. Advanced techniques (e.g., `__slots__`) can restrict dynamic attribute creation, but this is not covered here.

### 4.3 Class Attributes
Class attributes are shared across all instances of a class and belong to the class itself, not individual objects. They are defined outside the `__init__` method, typically at the class level.

**Example: Class Attribute for Cookies**
```python
class StarCookie:
    milk = 0.1  # Class attribute (liters of milk per cookie)

    def __init__(self, color, weight):
        self.color = color
        self.weight = weight

# Create objects
star_cookie_1 = StarCookie("red", 15)
star_cookie_2 = StarCookie("blue", 16)

# Access class attribute
print(star_cookie_1.milk)  # Output: 0.1
print(star_cookie_2.milk)  # Output: 0.1
print(StarCookie.milk)     # Output: 0.1
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `milk` is a class attribute, shared by all `StarCookie` objects and the class itself.
  - Accessing `milk` via objects (`star_cookie_1.milk`) or the class (`StarCookie.milk`) returns the same value (`0.1`).

**Modifying Class Attributes**:
```python
# Modify class attribute for a specific object
star_cookie_1.milk = 0.2
print(star_cookie_1.milk)  # Output: 0.2 (instance-specific attribute created)
print(star_cookie_2.milk)  # Output: 0.1 (unchanged, uses class attribute)
print(StarCookie.milk)     # Output: 0.1 (class attribute unchanged)

# Modify class attribute for all objects
StarCookie.milk = 0.3
print(star_cookie_1.milk)  # Output: 0.2 (instance attribute overrides class attribute)
print(star_cookie_2.milk)  # Output: 0.3 (uses updated class attribute)
print(StarCookie.milk)     # Output: 0.3 (class attribute updated)
```

- **Explanation**:
  - Changing `milk` for `star_cookie_1` creates an instance-specific attribute, leaving the class attribute and other objects unchanged.
  - Changing `StarCookie.milk` updates the class attribute, affecting all objects that don’t have an instance-specific `milk` attribute.
  - This demonstrates the difference between instance and class attributes.

**Inspecting Attributes with `__dict__`**:
```python
print(star_cookie_1.__dict__)  # Output: {'color': 'red', 'weight': 15, 'milk': 0.2}
print(star_cookie_2.__dict__)  # Output: {'color': 'blue', 'weight': 16}
print(StarCookie.__dict__)     # Output: {'__module__': '__main__', 'milk': 0.3, ...}
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `__dict__` shows the attributes of an object or class as a dictionary.
  - `star_cookie_1` includes `milk` because it was modified for that instance.
  - `star_cookie_2` does not include `milk`, as it uses the class attribute.
  - `StarCookie.__dict__` shows `milk` as a class attribute, along with other class metadata.

**Key Takeaway**: Instance attributes are unique to each object and set via `__init__`. Class attributes are shared across all instances and defined at the class level. Care must be taken to avoid unintended attribute creation due to typos.

## 5. Working with Methods

### 5.1 Defining Methods
Methods are functions defined within a class that describe an object’s behavior. They always take `self` as the first parameter, referring to the calling object.

**Syntax**:
```python
class ClassName:
    def method_name(self, param1, param2):
        # Method logic
        self.attribute = param1  # Access or modify attributes
```

### 5.2 Example: Robot Class with Methods
```python
class Robot:
    def __init__(self, battery_level):
        self.battery_level = battery_level

    def enter_charge_mode(self):
        self.battery_level += 1

# Create object
my_robot = Robot(50)
print(my_robot.battery_level)  # Output: 50
my_robot.enter_charge_mode()
print(my_robot.battery_level)  # Output: 51
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The `enter_charge_mode` method increases the `battery_level` attribute by 1.
  - `self` refers to `my_robot`, allowing the method to access and modify its attributes.
  - The method is called using dot notation: `my_robot.enter_charge_mode()`.

### 5.3 Example: YouTube Class with Subscribe Method
This example demonstrates a method that interacts with another object.

```python
class YouTube:
    def __init__(self, username, subscribers=0, subscriptions=0):
        self.username = username
        self.subscribers = subscribers
        self.subscriptions = subscriptions

    def subscribe(self, user):
        user.subscribers += 1  # Increase the other user's subscribers
        self.subscriptions += 1  # Increase this user's subscriptions

# Create objects
user_1 = YouTube("Elshad")
user_2 = YouTube("Renat")

# User 1 subscribes to User 2
user_1.subscribe(user_2)
print(f"{user_1.username} subscribers: {user_1.subscribers}, subscriptions: {user_1.subscriptions}")
# Output: Elshad subscribers: 0, subscriptions: 1
print(f"{user_2.username} subscribers: {user_2.subscribers}, subscriptions: {user_2.subscriptions}")
# Output: Renat subscribers: 1, subscriptions: 0

# User 2 subscribes to User 1
user_2.subscribe(user_1)
print(f"{user_1.username} subscribers: {user_1.subscribers}, subscriptions: {user_1.subscriptions}")
# Output: Elshad subscribers: 1, subscriptions: 1
print(f"{user_2.username} subscribers: {user_2.subscribers}, subscriptions: {user_2.subscriptions}")
# Output: Renat subscribers: 1, subscriptions: 1
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The `subscribe` method takes another `YouTube` object (`user`) as a parameter.
  - It increases the `subscribers` of the `user` object and the `subscriptions` of the calling object (`self`).
  - When `user_1.subscribe(user_2)` is called, `user_2`’s `subscribers` increases, and `user_1`’s `subscriptions` increases.
  - The method demonstrates how objects can interact, modeling real-world behavior (e.g., subscribing to a YouTube channel).

**Key Notes**:
- The `self` parameter is automatically passed when calling a method (e.g., `user_1.subscribe(user_2)` passes `user_1` as `self` and `user_2` as `user`).
- Methods can modify attributes of the calling object (`self`) or other objects passed as parameters.

## 6. Identifying Objects in Programs

### 6.1 What Qualifies as an Object?
Objects in OOP represent entities with:
- **Identity**: A unique existence (e.g., two mugs are distinct objects).
- **Attributes**: Properties describing the object’s state (e.g., a mug’s color, size, or fill level).
- **Behaviors**: Actions the object can perform (e.g., a phone can ring or send texts).

**Examples**:
- **Tangible Objects**:
  - **Mug**: Attributes (color, size, fill level); Behaviors (none typically modeled).
  - **Cookie**: Attributes (color, weight); Behaviors (decorate, consume).
  - **Cell Phone**: Attributes (color, battery level); Behaviors (ring, text, play music).
- **Non-Tangible Objects**:
  - **Bank Account**: Attributes (account number, balance); Behaviors (deposit, withdraw).
  - **Event**: Attributes (date, location); Behaviors (schedule, cancel).

**Key Insight**: Objects can represent both physical (e.g., cookies) and abstract (e.g., bank accounts) entities. Nouns (e.g., mug, event) are typically objects, while verbs (e.g., texting, ringing) describe behaviors (methods).

### 6.2 Challenges in Object-Oriented Design
- **Identifying Objects**: Determine which entities in your application can be modeled as objects (e.g., in an event management app, an `Event` is an object with attributes like `date` and methods like `schedule`).
- **Distinguishing Objects from Behaviors**: Nouns are objects; verbs are methods. For example, “texting” is not an object but a behavior of a `Phone` object.

## 7. Exercises

Below are exercises to reinforce OOP concepts, based on the examples provided in the documents. Each exercise includes a solution and explanation.

### Exercise 1: Create a Simple Class and Objects
**Task**: Create a `Car` class with attributes `model` and `speed`. Initialize two cars with different models and speeds, then print their attributes.

**Solution**:
```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, model, speed):
        self.model = model
        self.speed = speed

# Create objects
car_1 = Car("Toyota", 120)
car_2 = Car("Honda", 150)

# Print attributes
print(f"{car_1.model} speed: {car_1.speed}")  # Output: Toyota speed: 120
print(f"{car_2.model} speed: {car_2.speed}")  # Output: Honda speed: 150
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The `Car` class defines a blueprint with `model` and `speed` attributes.
  - The `__init__` method initializes these attributes for each object.
  - Two objects (`car_1`, `car_2`) are created with different attribute values, demonstrating independent instances.

### Exercise 2: Add a Class Attribute
**Task**: Modify the `Car` class to include a class attribute `fuel_type` set to `"Petrol"`. Create two cars and print the `fuel_type` for both objects and the class.

**Solution**:
```python
class Car:
    fuel_type = "Petrol"  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, model, speed):
        self.model = model
        self.speed = speed

# Create objects
car_1 = Car("Toyota", 120)
car_2 = Car("Honda", 150)

# Print class attribute
print(car_1.fuel_type)    # Output: Petrol
print(car_2.fuel_type)    # Output: Petrol
print(Car.fuel_type)      # Output: Petrol

# Modify class attribute for one object
car_1.fuel_type = "Diesel"
print(car_1.fuel_type)    # Output: Diesel
print(car_2.fuel_type)    # Output: Petrol
print(Car.fuel_type)      # Output: Petrol
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `fuel_type` is a class attribute, shared by all `Car` objects and the class itself.
  - Modifying `car_1.fuel_type` creates an instance-specific attribute, leaving `car_2` and `Car.fuel_type` unchanged.
  - This exercise highlights the difference between class and instance attributes.

### Exercise 3: Add a Method to a Class
**Task**: Add a method `accelerate` to the `Car` class that increases the `speed` by 10. Create a car, call the method, and print the updated speed.

**Solution**:
```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, model, speed):
        self.model = model
        self.speed = speed

    def accelerate(self):
        self.speed += 10

# Create object
car_1 = Car("Toyota", 120)
print(f"Initial speed: {car_1.speed}")  # Output: Initial speed: 120
car_1.accelerate()
print(f"Speed after acceleration: {car_1.speed}")  # Output: Speed after acceleration: 130
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The `accelerate` method modifies the `speed` attribute of the calling object (`self`).
  - Calling `car_1.accelerate()` increases `car_1.speed` by 10, demonstrating how methods can manipulate object attributes.

### Exercise 4: Object Interaction
**Task**: Create a `Student` class with attributes `name` and `friends` (default to 0). Add a method `make_friend` that increases the `friends` count of both the calling student and another student passed as a parameter. Create two students, make them friends, and print their friend counts.

**Solution**:
```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, friends=0):
        self.name = name
        self.friends = friends

    def make_friend(self, other_student):
        self.friends += 1
        other_student.friends += 1

# Create objects
student_1 = Student("Alice")
student_2 = Student("Bob")

# Make friends
student_1.make_friend(student_2)
print(f"{student_1.name} friends: {student_1.friends}")  # Output: Alice friends: 1
print(f"{student_2.name} friends: {student_2.friends}")  # Output: Bob friends: 1
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The `make_friend` method takes another `Student` object as a parameter and increments the `friends` attribute for both objects.
  - This mirrors the YouTube `subscribe` example, showing how objects can interact and modify each other’s attributes.

## 8. Key Takeaways
- **OOP Purpose**: OOP organizes code into modular, reusable objects, making it ideal for complex projects and custom data structures.
- **Classes and Objects**: Classes are blueprints; objects are instances with unique identities and attributes.
- **Attributes**: Instance attributes are unique to objects; class attributes are shared across all instances.
- **Methods**: Functions tied to objects, using `self` to access the object’s attributes.
- **Python Implementation**:
  - Use `class` keyword and PascalCase for class names.
  - Initialize attributes with `__init__` and set default values for optional parameters.
  - Access attributes and call methods using dot notation (e.g., `object.attribute`, `object.method()`).
  - Be cautious of dynamic attribute creation due to typos.
- **Real-World Modeling**: OOP models both tangible (e.g., cookies) and abstract (e.g., bank accounts) entities, focusing on nouns (objects) and verbs (methods).

---

## 9. Additional Notes
- **Predefined Classes**: Python’s standard library provides classes like strings and arrays, so you don’t need to redefine common data types.
- **Namespace Inspection**: Use `__dict__` to view an object’s or class’s attributes, useful for debugging.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Define all attributes in `__init__` to avoid accidental attribute creation.
  - Use class attributes for shared data but understand their behavior when modified.
  - Follow Python naming conventions (PascalCase for classes, snake_case for objects).
