# 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms – Python 

Welcome! This is my personal repo where I’m collecting everything I learn while studying **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using Python.

The goal?  
To **actually understand** this stuff — not just watch videos or read theory, but build things, break them, and write it all down.

## 📘 What's This Repo About?

This repo is my DSA learning hub. I'm using it to:

- Take structured notes on DSA concepts (with examples & edge cases)
- Write clean, from-scratch implementations of data structures & algorithms
- Practice solving real-world coding problems
- Track my progress and revisit tough concepts later
- Build a solid base for coding interviews & system design

I believe in learning by **doing**, so this repo is full of experiments, bugs I fixed, and code that’s constantly evolving.

## ✅ Topics I'm Covering

- **Time & Space Complexity (Big-O)**
- **Arrays & Strings**
- **Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)**
- **Stacks & Queues**
- **Hash Tables / Dictionaries**
- **Trees & Binary Search Trees**
- **Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, etc.)**
- **Recursion & Backtracking**
- **Sorting Algorithms (Merge, Quick, etc.)**
- **Searching (Binary, Linear, etc.)**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Divide & Conquer**
- **Greedy Algorithms**

## 🧠 How I'm Learning

- Watching videos & reading docs
- Rewriting key ideas in my own words
- Implementing everything manually (no shortcuts)
- Solving related practice problems (Leetcode, etc.)
- Refactoring my code after feedback or review
- Documenting mistakes & “aha!” moments

This repo isn’t just for studying — it’s also where I work through confusion, build muscle memory, and connect ideas across topics.

## ⚙️ Tools & Setup

- **Language:** Python 3
- **Editor:** VS Code, Jupyter for notes/visuals
- **Practice Sites:** Leetcode
- **Extras:** Diagrams, flowcharts, cheat sheets

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This is a growing, constantly evolving repo. Some sections are complete, others are messy and mid-refactor. That’s intentional — this is a **real** learning log.
