- **Daily Life Examples**:
  - **Queue System**: People waiting for concert tickets (First In, First Out - FIFO)
  - **Stack System**: Books on a table for library return (First In, Last Out - FILO)
- **Application Impact**: Performance of software directly depends on how data is stored, organized, and grouped
- **Industry Relevance**: Why companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook emphasize data structures in interviews

### 1.3 What is an Algorithm?
- **Definition**: A set of steps to accomplish a specific task
- **Real-World Example**: Flooring installation process

  3. Prepare the flooring area
  4. Determine layout in the space
  5. Trim door casings and complete installation
- **Daily Life Algorithms**:

### 1.4 Why Data Structures and Algorithms Are Important
- **Software Development Process**:
  1. **Input**: Take data in any form
  2. **Processing**: Apply operations using data structures and algorithms
  3. **Output**: Return processed data
- **Example**: Google Maps
  - Input: Starting and ending locations
  - Processing: Graph data structures + shortest path algorithms (like Dijkstra's)
  - Output: Optimal route between locations
- **Library Analogy**:
  - **Organized Library**: Books arranged by subject → Easy to find specific book
  - **Disorganized Library**: Books randomly distributed → Nearly impossible to find needed book
  - **Components**: Books (data), Organization system (data structure), Search process (algorithm)
- **Why Companies Test These Skills**:
  1. **Problem-Solving Ability**: Cannot rely on copy-paste solutions
  2. **Memory Management**: Prevents memory leaks and inefficient resource usage
  3. **Fundamental Assessment**: Limited interview time to evaluate core programming concepts
  4. **Adaptability**: Strong foundation enables quick learning of new technologies
